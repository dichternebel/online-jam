If you are looking for a guide on how to set up Jamulus using just your soundcard, please have a look here:
https://github.com/corrados/jamulus/blob/master/src/res/homepage/manual.md

This tutorial is for setting up Jamulus using your DAW in combination with a virtual soundcard instead of a direct I/O of your hardware soundcard. Currently only targeting Windows. Feel free to add wiki pages for your OS at will.

### Prerequisites

* Your DAW (whatever u use)
* Voicemeeter Banana (Win only): https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm
* Jamulus: https://sourceforge.net/projects/llcon/files/
* *Optional*: An internet faced private installation of *"Jamulus Server"*

### Setup & Configuration

**Don't use WIFI! It won't work!!!**<br/>
If you have no possibility to get a wired connection you should stop right now and wouldn't waste time. Your internet connection also has to be stable in order to produce a stream without too much jitter.

Of course you should have a soundcard with an ASIO driver that doesn't suck, but since you want to jam using your DAW this should be obviously the case.

### What you'll get
You and your m8s will have an audio based online jam and hear the same audio at the same time. The drawback: You will add a lot of latency to your current system. So during the jam you should switch between the jam audio and your own set if you want to play live and unquantized. 

### What you'll get...not!
There will be no sync: No wordclock, no midi-sync, no Ableton Link or whatever you are using. You will have to sync manually and agree to a tempo at the beginning of each song. ðŸ¤· 

### What you can expect
Although technically working imho this sucks! It's really hard to set up even for nerds. Audio quality highly depends on the connection quality of the connected clients. And this is not only ping or distance to the chosen server. The overall experience is only as good as the weekest part of the jam session and although every prerequiste seems to be fulfilled the result can be annoying.

If you still feel the need of starting an adventure, please refer to the Wiki pages for details:
